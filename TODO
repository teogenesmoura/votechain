NOW:
user history: user can register and log in
			  if user is logged in, user can create an election and add candidates to it
			  user can access the election page and vote for one of the candidates
			  the candidate ID is encrypted so no one knows to whom you voted
			  after the election is over, the candidate ID gets back to normal, vote counting is performed and
			  users are able to download the votechain 

LATER:
1 - create page to create election
	-> posts 'election' endpoint with name of election, number and name of candidates
2 - backend should:	
	-> validate candidates, check for duplicates and send appropriate response
	-> generate an encrypted value for each candidate and keep a map between real name and encrypted value
3 - frontend should:
	-> display result of the query, lead to election page
